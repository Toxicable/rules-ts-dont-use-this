# TypeScript devserver

This development server is very simple. It's meant to be a convenient step in
the "getting started" workflow. Once you have any real requirements, you should
develop against your real frontend server instead.

This devserver includes the "concatjs" bundling strategy. If you use a different
frontend server, you should port this library to whatever language you run in.
Contributions of such libraries are welcome.
