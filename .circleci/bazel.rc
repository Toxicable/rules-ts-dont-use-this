# These options are enabled when running on CI
# We do this by copying this file to /etc/bazel.bazelrc at the start of the build.

# Don't be spammy in the logs
build --noshow_progress

# Don't run manual tests
test --test_tag_filters=-manual

# Print all the options that apply to the build.
# This helps us diagnose which options override others
# (e.g. /etc/bazel.bazelrc vs. /.bazelrc)
build --announce_rc

# Enable experimental CircleCI bazel remote cache proxy
build --experimental_remote_spawn_cache --remote_rest_cache=http://localhost:7643

# Prevent unstable environment variables from tainting cache keys
build --experimental_strict_action_env

# Save downloaded repositories such as the go toolchain
# This directory can then be included in the CircleCI cache
# It should save time running the first build
build --experimental_repository_cache=/home/circleci/bazel_repository_cache

# Workaround https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/3645
# Bazel doesn't calculate the memory ceiling correctly when running under Docker.
# Limit Bazel to consuming 2560K of RAM
build --local_resources=2560,1.0,1.0
# Also limit Bazel's own JVM heap to stay within our 4G container limit
startup --host_jvm_args=-Xmx3g
# Since the default CircleCI container has only 4G, limiting the memory
# is required to keep Bazel from exhausting the memory. These values
# are determined experimentally. If the Bazel process crashes without
# any error messages then the --local_resources and --host_jvm_args
# memory should be reduced. If the Bazel process errors out within
# a "JVM out of memory" error then the --host_jvm_args memory should
# be increased.
